# draf-ndr-scraper

## A project written in Python to help you downloading dutch horse racing results
Have you ever thought about having all the dutch harness racing results from [ndr.nl](https://ndr.nl/) since 1995 stored on your computer to analyse them? Probably not. But this project helps you downloading them anyway.

You need Chrome 116 to fit the chromedriver.exe in this repository. 


## Usage
```
> python ndr_scraper.py
```
Then you just have to enter the starting year and month with '-' between them (e.g. '2022-01'). And after that the last year and month of the time period for which you would like to download the results.

And I think I should add something like "Please scrape responsibly".
